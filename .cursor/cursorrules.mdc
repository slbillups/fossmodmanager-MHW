# Project Overview: FossModManager (React + Tauri)

**Goal:** Create a platform-agnostic mod manager with a minimalistic, modern desktop UI, similar in concept to Lutris or Vortex but simpler.

**Current State (Frontend Skeleton):**

*   **Framework:** React + Vite
*   **Desktop App Framework:** Tauri (backend logic not yet implemented)
*   **UI Library:** Ant Design (antd)
*   **Layout:**
    *   Main window using Ant Design's `Layout` component.
    *   Collapsible `Sider` (sidebar) on the left, controlled by a floating button.
    *   Main `Content` area occupies the rest of the space.
    *   No header or footer bars to maximize content space and feel more like a desktop app.
*   **Components:**
    *   `App.jsx`: Root component, sets up main layout and state (sidebar collapse).
    *   `Sidebar.jsx`: Renders the collapsible menu (currently with "Game List" and "Settings" placeholders using Ant Design `Menu` and icons).
    *   `MainContent.jsx`: Renders the primary view area.
        *   Displays an Ant Design `Table` listing games (mock data).
        *   Includes action buttons ("Check for updates", "Update now") above the table.
        *   The game table supports row expansion.
        *   Expanding a game row displays an inner Ant Design `Table` listing mods for that game (mock data).
    *   `AppCustomStyles.css`: Contains minor CSS overrides, primarily for positioning the floating collapse button.

**Backend:**

*   No Rust backend logic has been implemented yet. All data is currently mocked in the frontend components.

**Next Steps (Frontend):**

*   Refine UI/UX (e.g., add mod actions, improve table styling).
*   Implement state management if needed beyond simple component state.
*   Connect frontend actions (button clicks, etc.) to Tauri commands (once backend exists).

**Next Steps (Backend - Future):**

*   Implement Tauri commands in Rust for core logic:
    *   Game detection.
    *   Mod discovery/management.
    *   Prefix management.
    *   Update checking.
    *   Running games/tools.
