 # Project Overview

This project is a platform-agnostic mod manager built using Tauri, React, and Ant Design.

# Backend goals

- **Project goal:** To create a tauri-powered platform-agnostic mod manager for Steam games, similar to that of Windows-only mod managers(Vortex Mod Manager for example). Native desktop integration, no offline use other than if the user wants to find a new add-on...

# Design Goals

- **Overall Aesthetic:** Modern, bespoke, and minimalistic desktop application.
- **Theme:** Dark theme, aiming for very dark colors.
- **Feel:** The application should feel like a native desktop application, avoiding styles or layouts that appear overtly "web-like" or look like a simple port of a web UI.
- **Layout:**
    - The primary view consists of a main content area.
    - A top toolbar within the content area houses main navigation (e.g., "Games", "Settings") and primary actions (e.g., "Check for updates"). Buttons in the toolbar should be styled subtly to integrate with the dark theme, avoiding generic default web styles.
    - The main content displays a table listing games.
    - Clicking a game row expands it to show a nested table of installed mods for that game.
    - Indicators (like an exclamation mark) are used instead of checkboxes where appropriate (e.g., for update notifications).
- **Avoid:**
    - Traditional sidebars (navigation is in the top toolbar).
    - Floating action buttons or elements disconnected from the main content flow.
    - Default, bright blue primary buttons or other overtly web-centric styles.
